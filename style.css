### How to Use This CSS File:

1.  **Create a new file** in the same folder as your `index.html` and name it `style.css`.
2.  **Copy and paste** the code above into your new `style.css` file.
3.  **Link the stylesheet** in your `index.html` file by replacing the entire `<style>...</style>` block in the `<head>` section with the following line:
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    ```

After these changes, your page will look and function exactly the same, but with the custom CSS neatly organized in its own fi
